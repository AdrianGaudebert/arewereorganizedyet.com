AWRY has one rule, and one exception to that rule. The rule is: **your commit message has to be funny**. The exception is if the circumstances around the reorg are not fun (if, say, an entire office is fired at once). 

Look at previous commits to get inspiration and see how to provide an update (hint: it's super simple).

Oh, and also, please don't divulge non-public information in your commit message or pull request title.
